# Causal Inference in Decision Intelligence ‚Äì Part 0: A Roadmap to the Series

*Boost the efficiency of decision-making with applied Causal Inference.*

---

## Introduction

**Causal Inference** is a powerful framework for analyzing cause-and-effect relationships. Its full potential unfolds when combined with:

- Decision Analysis  
- Macroeconomic Analysis  
- Econometrics  
- Game Theory  

This integrated perspective forms the foundation of **Decision Intelligence** ‚Äî a holistic analytical approach that bridges multiple disciplines to drive strategic, data-informed decisions.

This series of articles demonstrates how Decision Intelligence transforms decision-making through applied Causal Inference techniques. The project is composed of **distinct subprojects**, each addressing a specific component of this integrated framework.

## Project Goals: What to Expect

The aim of this series is to showcase how **Causal Inference** can solve complex problems using fundamental machine learning and statistical methods.

### Goals:
- Show that Causal Inference acts as a unifying thread across diverse analytical domains.  
- Enable a systems-level understanding of decision-making.  
- Present intuitive insights, minimizing mathematical formalism.  
- Bridge the gap between theoretical rigor and practical implementation.

## Approach

Rather than delivering an exhaustive overview of Data Science or Decision Intelligence theory, this series takes a **hands-on, intuitive approach**. Key principles:

- Accessible to junior analysts, insightful for experienced data scientists.  
- Technique-agnostic: integrates any statistical or ML method.  
- Focus on real-world use cases and relatable narratives.  
- Reliance on essential tools: basic statistics, linear regression, and experimental Python packages (e.g. DoWhy).  
- Demonstrate that 90% of problems can be solved with simple models ‚Äî deep learning isn't always necessary.
